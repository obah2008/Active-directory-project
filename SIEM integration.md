# SIEM integration
As stated in the projects overview the SIEM solution that I'll be using is Splunk, and it will be configured and setup on an Ubuntu server.

## installing Splunk
To install splunk on the Ubuntu Server:
- SSH into the server and make sure all the system packages are updated using  
   ```bash 
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
