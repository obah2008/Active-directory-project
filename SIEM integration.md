# SIEM integration
As stated in the projects overview the SIEM solution that I'll be using is Splunk, and it will be configured and setup on an Ubuntu server.

## installing Splunk
To install splunk on the Ubuntu Server:
- SSH into the server and make sure all the system packages are updated using  
```bash 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```
- I'll download Splunk enteprise with the following command:
```bash
sudo wget -O splunk-9.4.2-e9664af3d956-linux-amd64.deb "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.2/linux/splunk-9.4.2-e9664af3d956-linux-amd64.deb"
```

- install Splunk enteprise by using the following command
```bash
sudo dpkg -i splunk-9.4.2-e9664af3d956-linux-amd64.deb
```
- once installed cd to to directory splunk was installed on 
```bash
cd /opt/splunk/bin
```
- Start the service
```bash
./splunk start
```
- After the installation is complete, set a username and password
- Access the Splunk dashboard with a browser using the servers IP address and the port the Splunk service listens on.

### Configuring Splunk
I'll be configuring Splunk to enable it receive and index logs from the endpoints seamlessly
- Step 1: I'll be installing the Splunk add-on for windows to helps parse and normalize Windows log data.
- Step 2: Create a new index to store all the logs from the endpoints
- Step 3: Configure the port Splunk will be receiving the logs on (Port 9997) and add a new Azure NSG inbound rule to allow traffic on port 9997 to the Splunk VM.
